# FastPitch

## Overview

The FastPitch model was proposed in [FASTPITCH: PARALLEL TEXT-TO-SPEECH WITH PITCH PREDICTION](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06873.pdf)  by Adrian Łancucki. 
What type of model is Fast Pitch? It is a Mel spectrogram generator (part of a speech to text model engine) that mainly comprises of two Feed Forward Transformer stacks.
Fast Pitch is used to transform text to a spectrogram to be used in wave form generation in speech synthesis.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*
We present FastPitch, a fully-parallel text-to-speech model
based on FastSpeech, conditioned on fundamental frequency
contours. The model predicts pitch contours during inference.
By altering these predictions, the generated speech can be more expressive, better match the semantic of the utterance, and in the end more engaging to the listener. 
Uniformly increasing or decreasing pitch with FastPitch generates speech that resembles the voluntary modulation of voice. 
Conditioning on frequency contours improves the overall quality of synthesized speech, making it comparable to state-of-the-art.
It does not introduce an overhead, and FastPitch retains the favorable, fully-parallel Transformer architecture, with over 900× real-time factor for mel-spectrogram synthesis of a typical utterance.
*

Tips:
To reiterate this is a mel spectrogram generator, to leverage this model in your own TTS Pipeline you will need a vocoder e.g WaveGlow or HifiGan.
